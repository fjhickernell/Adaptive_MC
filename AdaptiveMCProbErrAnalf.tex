\abstract{We attempt a probabilistic analysis of simple Monte Carlo, achieving probabilistic error bounds when the kurtosis is controlled.  The algorithm uses a sample size that depends adaptively on the estimated variance of the integrand.  Thus, the algorithm is nonlinear (depending essentially on the function).  The advantage of what is done here over standard error analysis (complexity theory) is that the algorithm does not depend a priori on the scale of the problem (in this case the variance) to determine the number of samples.   Our intention, if what is done here is correct, is to try to extend this to the more sophisticated sampling schemes and infinite dimensional problems.}


\section{Introduction}

Monte Carlo algorithms for multidimensional integrals have been in use for half a century.  The integral or mean, $\mu$, of a $d$-variate function $f: \reals^d \to \reals$, i.e.,
\begin{equation*} 
\mu= \mu(f) = \int_{\reals^d} f(\vx) \rho(\vx) \, \dif \vx,
\end{equation*}
is approximated by the sample mean of integrand values,
\begin{equation} \label{samplemean}
\hmu_n = \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i, \qquad Y_i = f(\vX_i).
\end{equation}
Here $\rho: \reals^d \to [0,\infty)$ is a specified probability density function, e.g., the uniform density on a cube or the normal density.  For simple Monte Carlo the points $\vX_1, \vX_2, \ldots$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with the marginal probability density function $\rho$.  Other choices, such as quasi-random points, may provide greater accuracy, but this paper deals with only simple Monte Carlo.

It is natural to that practitioners would want an automatic Monte Carlo algorithm that takes as its input the integrand, $f$, the probability density, $\rho$, and an error tolerance $\varepsilon$, and produces a value $\hmu_n$ that is within $\varepsilon$ of $\mu$ while requiring only a reasonable sample size, $n$.  While there is an extensive theory on Monte Carlo algorithms, there are some key gaps that must be filled to make it an automatic algorithm.  The aim of this article is to provide such an algorithm.  Next this problem of approximating $\mu$ is summarized from the perspective of a statistician and then from the perspective of an information-based complexity theorist or numerical analyst.

{\bf Art will add and edit this material in this section, especially the next subsection.}

\subsection{The Statistician's Perspective} \label{statperspsec}  
The statistician's sees this a problem of constructing non-parametric, fixed-width confidence intervals for $\mu$.  Setting $Y=f(\vX)$, the goal is to approximate its mean, $\mu=E(Y)$, from an i.i.d.\ sample, $Y_i=f(\vX_i)$, $i=1, \ldots, n$, to obtain an expression
\begin{equation} \label{abserr}
\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n-\mu} \le \varepsilon \right] \geq 1-\alpha.
\end{equation}
Here taking $\alpha=5\%$ corresponds to a $95\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ with half-width $\varepsilon$.  Although the probability distribution for $Y$ is not readily obtainable, the Central Limit Theorem states that the sample mean, $\hmu_n$, is approximately normally distributed for large $n$.  This fact may be used to determine the sample size $n$ to give an approximate confidence interval, 
\begin{equation} \label{CLT}
\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n-\mu} \le \frac{z_{\alpha/2} \sigma} {\sqrt{n}} \right] \approx 1-\alpha,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^2 = \var(Y)=E[(Y-\mu)^2]$, and $z_\alpha$ denotes the $(1-\alpha)100\%$ percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution.  This suggests taking a sample size of $n=\lceil (z_{\alpha/2}\sigma/\varepsilon)^2\rceil$ to attain \eqref{abserr}.  Since $\sigma$ is not known a priori, it must be approximated by the sample variance of the $Y_i$:
\begin{equation} \label{samplevar}
\hsigma^2 = \fudge^2 \hv_{n_{\sigma}}, \quad \text{where} \quad \hv_{n_{\sigma}} = \frac 1{n_{\sigma}-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{\sigma}} (Y_i- \hmu_{n_{\sigma}})^2, \quad \hmu_{n_{\sigma}} = \frac 1{n_{\sigma}} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{\sigma}} Y_i.
\end{equation}
The variance inflation factor, $\fudge>1$, accounts for the fact the unbiased variance estimator, $\hv_{n_{\sigma}}$, may be larger or smaller than the true variance, $\sigma^2$.  Then the sample size for the sample mean may be chosen as $n=\lceil (z_{\alpha/2}\hsigma/\varepsilon)^2\rceil$.  To avoid dependence between $\hsigma^2$ and $\hmu_n$, an independent sample of $Y_i$, should be used to compute $\hmu_n$, i.e., 
\begin{equation} \label{simpleMCest}
\hmu_n = \frac 1n \sum_{i=n_{\sigma}+1}^{n_{\sigma}+n} Y_i,
\end{equation}
for a total cost of $n_{\sigma}+n$ samples.

While this fixed-width confidence interval may be often correct, it is not guaranteed. There are two approximations, whose errors must be understood and controlled: approximating the distribution $\hmu_n$ as a Gaussian distribution, and approximating $\sigma^2$ by the sample variance.  The key to controlling these two errors, as seen in Theorem \ref{mainadaptthm}, is in assuming a bound on the kurtosis, i.e., 
\begin{equation} \label{boundedkurt}
\kappa=\kurt(Y) = \frac{E[(Y-\mu)^4]}{\sigma^4} \le \kappa_{\max}.
\end{equation}
A bounded kurtosis means that $Y$ has or does not have ????? A bounded kurtosis allows one to reliably bound $\var(Y)$ in terms of the sample variance, and also allows one to obtain a rigorous bound on the deviation of the sample mean from the true mean.  It was shown by \cite[Corollary 2]{BahSav56} that nonparametric confidence intervals are impossible for convex sets of distributions. Assuming bounded kurtosis produces a non-convex set of possible distributions for $Y$.

Another approach to obtaining a fixed-width confidence interval for $\mu$ would be to assume an upper bound on $\sigma^2$ and apply Chebyshev's inequality.  The disadvantage of this approach is that while it might work for $Y=f(\vX)$, it would not work for $cY=cf(\vX)$ if $c$ were large enough, since $\var(cY)=c^2 \var(Y)$.  However, since $\kurt(cY)=\kurt(Y)$ if the procedure for obtaining a fixed-width confidence interval that is described in this article works for $Y$, it also works for $cY$.

\subsection{The Information-Based Complexity Theorist's or Numerical Analyst's Perspective} 
The information-based complexity theorist or numerical analyst sees this as a multivariate integration problem.  There are a myriad of cubature methods, each making certain assumptions on the domain of integration and the smoothness of the integrand, $f$, and deriving error bounds in terms of some semi-norm of $f$. Simple Monte Carlo methods work for functions with low degrees of smoothness and the natural space of integrands is $\cl_2$, where the $\cl_{p}$ norm is defined as
\begin{equation} \label{Lpnormdef}
\norm[p]{f} :=\left\{\int_{\reals^d} \abs{f(\vx)}^p \rho(\vx) \, \dif \vx\right\}^{1/p}.
\end{equation}
The root mean square error of the simple Monte Carlo method is $\norm[2]{f-\mu(f)}/\sqrt{n}$.

Again, the practical problem again in applying this error analysis to determine the sample size, $n$, to guarantee the desired error, one must know the size of the integrand, $\norm[2]{f-\mu(f)}=\sqrt{\var(Y)}=\sigma$.  Analogous to the statistical argument given above, the solution to this problem is not to look at balls of integrands, i.e., 
\begin{equation} \label{ballintegdef}
\cb_{\sigma_{\max}} = \{ f \in \cl_2 : \norm[2]{f-\mu(f)} \le \sigma_{\max}\}, 
\end{equation}
but to look at \emph{cones} of integrands 
\begin{equation}\label{coneintegdef}
\cc_{\kappa_{\max}} = \{f \in \cl_4 : \norm[4]{f-\mu(f)} \le \kappa_{\max}^{1/4} \norm[2]{f-\mu(f)} \}.
\end{equation}
This condition is the same as \eqref{boundedkurt}.  Whereas $f$ lying in the ball  $\cb_{\sigma_{\max}}$ does not guarantee $cf$ lies in that same ball, $f$ lying in the cone $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$, does guarantee that $cf$ lies in that same cone.

Looking for algorithms that work well for cones of integrands, $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$, leads one to \emph{adaptive} algorithms.  The sample size used to estimate the integral is determined adaptively by first computing an upper bound on $\norm[2]{f-\mu(f)}$.  In information-based complexity theory it is known that adaptive information does not help for convex sets of integrands in the worst case and probabilistic settings \citep[Chapter 4, Theorem 5.2.1; Chapter 8, Corollary 5.3.1]{TraWasWoz88}.  Here, the cone, $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$ is not a convex set, so adaption can help.

Again, it should be stressed that the algorithm to be presented here is automatic.  It does not require information about $\norm[2]{f-\mu(f)}=\sigma$, but this quantity needs to be reliably estimated by the algorithm. Thus, the sample size needed, and consequently the time required, to estimate $\mu$ to within the prescribed error tolerance depends on how large $\norm[2]{f-\mu(f)}=\sigma$ is estimated to be.  The algorithm is adaptive, and its cost depends on the integrand.

\subsection{Illustrative Univariate Examples of Automatic Algorithms}

{\bf Lan will be adding to this section.}

Several commonly used software packages have automatic algorithms for integrating functions of a single variable.  These include 
\begin{itemize} 

\item {\tt quad} in MATLAB \citep{MAT7.12}, adaptive Simpson's rule based on {\tt adaptsim} by \cite{GanGau00a},

\item {\tt quadgk} in MATLAB \citep{MAT7.12}, adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature based on {\tt quadva} by \cite{Sha08a}, 

\item the {\tt chebfun} \citep{TrefEtal12} toolbox for MATLAB \citep{MAT7.12}, which approximates integrals by integrating interpolatory Chebyshev polynomial series for the integrands, 

\item {\tt NIntegrate} in Mathematica \citep{Mat8a}, which uses a number of adaptive rules for one dimensional integrals, 

\end{itemize}

For the first three of these automatic algorithms one can easily probe where they sample the integrand, feed the algorithms zero values, and then construct fooling functions that the automatic algorithms will return a zero value for the integral.  Figure \ref{foolfunfig} displays these fooling functions for the problem $\mu=\int_0^1 f(x) \, \dif x$ for the first three algorithms. Each of these algorithms is asked to provide an answer with an absolute error no greater than $10^{14}$, but in fact the the absolute error is $1$ for these fooling functions.  The algorithms {\tt quad} and {\tt chebfun} sample only about a dozen points before concluding that the function is zero, whereas the algorithm {\tt quadgk} samples a much larger number of points (only those between $0$ and $0.01$ are shown in the plot). algorithm

Another example is illustrated in Figure \ref{GaussTestFun} for the test function
\begin{align*}
f(\vx)=b_0\prod_{j=1}^d\left (a_j+b_j e^{-\frac{(x_j-h_j)^2}{c_j^2}}\right)+a_0
\end{align*}
where $\vx$ is the $d$ dimensional vector , $a_j$ is the addition parameter, $b_j$ is the function scale parameter, $c_j$ is the function shape parameter, $h_j$ is the center of the kernel, $b_0$ is the over multiplicity parameter, and $a_0$ is the over addition parameter. The exact integral is $\mu=\int_{[0,1]^d} f(\vx) \rho(\vx)\, \dif \vx$. where $\rho(\vx)$ is the probability density function.

In our numerical experiment, we choose 
\begin{itemize} 
\item dimension $d=1$ 
\item the probability density function $\rho=1$ which is uniformly distributed between $[0,1]$
\item the addition parameter $a_j=1$
\item the scale parameter $b_j$ between $[0.1,1]$ log uniformly distributed
\item the shape parameter $c_j$ between $[10^{-6},1]$ log uniformly distributed
\item the center of the kernel $h_j$ uniformly random between $[0,1]$
\item the over multiplicity parameter $b_0$ in terms of addition,scale,shape and center parameter in order to make the variance between $[10^{-2} 10^2]$, log uniformly distributed.
\item the over addition parameter $a_0$ in terms of addition,scale,shape, center and over multiplicity parameter in order to make the exact integral be 1.
\item 300 replications
\item variance inflation factor $\fudge=1.5$
\item the tolerance $\epsilon=0.001$
\item level of uncertainty $\alpha=5\%$
\item $n_0=1024$ for the simple algorithm and $n_0=1024*128$ for the heavy duty algorithm.
\item For the iid sampling, kurtosis max  is 9.2085; for the iid heavy duty sampling ,it is 1051.9.
\end{itemize}
For the iid sampling, the successful rate is only 70\% whereas the heavy duty iid sampling, the successful 
rate is above 95\%. in the graph, the square means it reaches the sample limit; the star mean the kurtosis is less than the kurtosis maximum. the dot is the general case.
For the Sobol sampling the successful rate is around 70\% , the heavy duty case, the successful rate is almost 100\%. Clearly, Sobol takes less time than iid sampling.For the quad,quadgk, chebfun and chebfun heavy duty, they take less time but could not reach a higher tolerance as we expected.




\section{Simple Monte Carlo with Guaranteed Error Estimation}

\subsection{Reliably Bounding the Variance} To estimate or bound the variance of $Y=f(\vX)$ one must have a finite fourth moment.  The definitions of the variance and kurtosis of $Y$ in Section \ref{statperspsec} may be extended naturally to $f \in \cl_4$ in terms of $\cl_p$ norms defined in \eqref{Lpnormdef} as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\sigma^2=\var(Y) = \var(f) = \norm[2]{f - \mu(f)}^2, \qquad \kappa=\kurt(Y) = \kurt(f) = \frac{\norm[4]{f - \mu(f)}^4}{\norm[2]{f - \mu(f)}^4}.
\end{equation*}
Thus, one may speak about $Y$ or $f$ interchangeably. If $1 \le q \le p$, then by H\"older's inequality,
\begin{align*}\label{LP}
\norm[q]{f} &=\left\{\int_{\reals^d} \abs{f(\vx)}^q \rho(\vx) \, \dif \vx\right\}^{1/q}\\
\nonumber & \le \left\{\int_{\reals^d} \abs{f(\vx)}^p \, \rho(\vx) \, \dif \vx \right\}^{1/p} \left\{\int_{\reals^d} 1^{p/(p-q)} \, \rho(\vx) \, \dif \vx\right\}^{(p-q)/(pq)} = \norm[p]{f}.
\end{align*}
Thus, $\kappa=\kurt(f) \ge 1$, provided $\sigma^2=\var(f)>0$.  For $\sigma^2=\var(f)=0$, one defines $\kappa=\kurt(f)=1$.

As mentioned in \eqref{samplevar}, a practical upper bound on $\sigma^2$ may be obtained in terms of the sample variance.  The justification for this statement is contained in the lemma below. Two well-known probability inequalities that are needed here and later are quoted in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma} \label{ChebCantlem}  Suppose that $Z$ is any random variable with finite second moment.  For any $a >0 $,
\begin{gather*}
\Prob\left[\abs{Z-E(Z)} \ge a \right] \le \frac{\var(Z)}{a^2} \qquad \text{Chebyshev's inequality \citep[6.1c]{LinBai10a}} , \\
\Prob[Z-E[Z] \geq a]\leq \frac{\var(Z)}{a^2+\var(Z)} \qquad
\text{Cantelli's Inequality \citep[6.1e]{LinBai10a}}.
\end{gather*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma} \label{varbdlem}  Suppose that $Y$ is a random variable with finite fourth moment, and with mean $\mu$, variance $\sigma^2$, and kurtosis $\kappa$.  Let $\hv_{n}$ denote the unbiased sample variance based on $n$ i.i.d.\ samples, $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ as defined in \eqref{samplevar}.  Then for any $\alpha \in (0,1]$ it follows that
\begin{subequations} \label{sampvarbd}
\begin{gather} \label{sampvarup}
\Prob \left[\frac{\hv_{n}}{1 - \sqrt{\left ( \kappa  - \frac{n-3}{n-1}\right)\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha n}\right)}} > \sigma^2 \right] \ge 1 - \alpha, \\
\label{sampvarlo}
\Prob \left[\frac{\hv_{n}}{1 + \sqrt{\left ( \kappa  - \frac{n-3}{n-1}\right)\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha n}\right)}} < \sigma^2 \right] \ge 1 - \alpha.
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} It is known that the sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the variance, i.e., $E(\hv_n)=\sigma^2$.  It is also known from \cite{??} that the variance of the sample variance can be expressed in terms of $\sigma^2$ and $\kappa$ as
\[
\var(\hv_n) = \frac{\sigma^4}{n} \left ( \kappa  - \frac{n-3}{n-1} \right).
\]
Choosing
$$a=\sqrt{\var(\hv_n) \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} } = \sigma^2\sqrt{\left(\kappa-\frac{n-3}{n-1}\right)\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha n}\right)} >0,
$$
it follows from Cantelli's inequality (Lemma \ref{ChebCantlem})  that
\begin{multline*}
\Prob\left[\hv_n-\sigma^2 \geq
\sigma^2\sqrt{\left(\kappa-\frac{n-3}{n-1}\right)\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha n}\right)} \right]  = \Prob\left[\hv_n-\sigma^2 \geq
a \right]\\
 \leq \frac{\var(\hv_n)}{a^2+\var(\hv_n)} 
=\frac{\var(\hv_n)}{\var(\hv_n) \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}+\var(\hv_n)}  
=\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\right)+1}=\alpha.
\end{multline*}
Then \eqref{sampvarup} follows directly.  By a similar argument, applying Cantelli's inequality to the expression $\Prob\left[-\hv_n+\sigma^2 \ge a \right]$ implies  \eqref{sampvarlo}. \qed
\end{proof}

Lemma \ref{varbdlem} provides probabilistic justification to use $\hsigma^2 = \fudge^2 \hv_{n_{\sigma}}$ as a reliable upper bound for $\sigma^2=\var(Y)=\var(f)$.  One can claim that $\Prob(\hsigma^2 \ge \sigma^2) \ge 1-\alpha$ assuming that
\begin{multline}
\frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{\left ( \kappa  - \frac{n_{\sigma}-3}{n_{\sigma}-1}\right)\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha n_{\sigma}}\right)}} \le \fudge^2
\\
\iff \kappa \le \frac{n_{\sigma}-3}{n_{\sigma}-1} + \left(\frac{ \alpha n_{\sigma}}{1-\alpha}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{\fudge^2}\right)^2 =: \kappa_{\max} (\alpha,n_{\sigma},\fudge). \label{kappamaxdef}
\end{multline}

Figure \ref{kurtmaxcompareNfig}a shows how large a kurtosis can be accommodated for a given $n_{\sigma}$, $\alpha$, and variance inflation factor $\fudge=1.5$.  Note that for $n=30$, a common rule of thumb for applying the central limit theorem, even $\alpha=0.1$ gives $\kappa_{\max}$ of only about $2$, which is rather restrictive.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Determining the Sample Size} The other issue that needs to be addressed is a tight probabilistic error bound to replace the asymptotic or approximate error bound given by the Central Limit Theorem, \eqref{CLT}.   Chebyshev's inequality implies that the number of function evaluations needed to ensure that $\hmu_n$ satisfies the error tolerance with high probability is
\begin{subequations} \label{ChebErr}
\begin{gather} \label{ChebProbEst}
\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n-\mu} \le \varepsilon \right] \ge 1-\alpha \quad \text{for } n \ge N_{C}(\varepsilon/\sigma,\alpha),\ f \in \cl_2,
\intertext{where }
\label{NCdef}
N_{C}(\varepsilon,\alpha) :=\left \lceil \frac{1}{\alpha\varepsilon^2} \right \rceil.
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
However, this sample size is much larger than that given by the Central Limit Theorem, as shown in Figure \ref{kurtmaxcompareNfig}b.

Since higher order moments of the integrand are required to guarantee an upper bound on the true variance in terms of the sample variance, it is sensible to use these higher order moments to obtain smaller sample sizes.  A smaller sample size than \eqref{NCdef} with a rigorous probabilistic bound can be found by invoking the following inequality. 
\begin{lemma}[Non-uniform Berry-Esseen Inequality] \cite[Theorem 5.16, p. 168]{Pet95a} \label{BE} Let $Y_1,\dots,Y_n$ be i.i.d.\ random variables.  Suppose that
$\mu=E(Y_i)$, $\var(Y_i)=\sigma^2>0$,  and $M=E\abs{Y_i - \mu}^3/\sigma^3 < \infty$.
Then
\[
\abs{\Prob\left[\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\mu)<x
\right]-\Phi(x)}\leq \frac{A M}{\sqrt{n}(1+\abs{x})^{3}}.
\] for all x,
where $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of a standard Gaussian (normal) random variable, and $A$ is some number satisfying $0.4097\leq A\leq 0.5600$.
\end{lemma}

The right hand side of this inequality bounds how far the probability distribution of sample mean deviates from the Central Limit Theorem approximation.  This right hand side vanishes as either the sample size or $\abs{x}$ tends to infinity. This inequality requires that $Y=f(\vX)$, have a finite third moment, i.e., $f \in \cl_3$, which is a weaker assumption than is needed to bound the variance in terms of the sample variance in Lemma \ref{varbdlem}. Recalling that $Y_i = f(\vX_i)$, $\mu=E(Y_i)$, and $\hmu_n =
(Y_1 + \cdots + Y_n)/n$, this
Berry-Esseen inequality then implies that for positive $x$,
\begin{align} 
\nonumber
\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n - \mu} <\frac{\sigma x}{\sqrt{n}}\right]&=\Prob\left[\hmu_n - \mu<\frac{\sigma x}{\sqrt{n}}\right]-\Prob\left[\hmu_n - \mu <-\frac{\sigma x}{\sqrt{n}}\right]\\
\nonumber
&\ge \left[\Phi(x)-\frac{0.56 M}{\sqrt{n}(1+\abs{x})^{3}}\right] -\left[\Phi(-x) + \frac{0.56 M}{\sqrt{n}(1+\abs{x})^{3}}\right]\\
&=1-2\left(\Phi(-x) - \frac{0.56 M}{\sqrt{n}(1+\abs{x})^{3}}\right). \label{BEresult}
\end{align}
Letting $x=\varepsilon\sqrt{n}/\sigma$, the probability of
making an error less than $\varepsilon$ is bounded below by $1-\alpha$, i.e., 
\begin{subequations} \label{proberrcritsampleBE}
\begin{equation}
\Prob[\abs{\hmu_n -\mu}<\varepsilon] \geq 1-\alpha,  \quad \text{provided } n \ge N_B(\varepsilon/\sigma,\alpha,M), \ f \in \cl_3,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}\label{NB}
N_B(b,\alpha,M) := \min \left \{ n \in \naturals : \Phi\left(-b \sqrt{n}  \right)+\frac{0.56M}{\sqrt{n}\left(1+ b\sqrt{n} \right)^{3}}
\le \frac{\alpha}{2} \right \}.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

As shown in Figure \ref{kurtmaxcompareNfig}b, for a range of $\alpha$, the sample size guaranteeing coverage of the confidence interval, $N_B$, is quite close to the sample size for the approximate Central Limit Theorem confidence interval, $N_G$, however, $N_B$ may be somewhat larger for very small or rather large $\alpha$.  In general $N_B$ is significantly smaller than $N_C$, but not always.  A disadvantage of \eqref{proberrcritsampleBE} is that class of integrands, $\cl_3$, is smaller than that in \eqref{ChebErr}, but this typically a small price to pay given the much smaller cost of computation.

The theorem below combines the results on estimating the variance with the sample sizes arising from Chebyshev's inequality and the Berry-Esseen inequality.  These lead to an adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm with a probabilistic error guarantee.

\begin{theorem} \label{mainadaptthm} Specify the following parameters defining the algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item sample size for variance estimation, $n_{\sigma} \in \naturals$,
\item inflation factor for variance estimation, $\fudge \in (1,\infty)$,
\item uncertainty tolerance, $\alpha\in (0,1)$, and $\talpha = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \alpha}$, and
\item absolute error tolerance, $\varepsilon \in (0,\infty)$. 
\end{itemize} 
For $\kappa_{\max}=\kappa_{\max}(n_{\sigma},\talpha,\fudge)$, as defined in \eqref{kappamaxdef}, define the cone of integrands functions with bounded kurtosis, $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$, according to \eqref{coneintegdef}.  For any $f \in \cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$, compute the sample variance, $\hv_{n_{\sigma}}$ using a simple random sample of size $n_{\sigma}$. Use this to approximate the variance of $f$ by $\hsigma^2 = \fudge^2 \hv_{n_{\sigma}}$ as in \eqref{samplevar}.  Next define a sample size $n = N_{CB}(\varepsilon/\hsigma,\talpha,\kappa_{\max}^{3/4})$, where
\begin{equation} \label{NCBdef}
N_{CB}(b,\alpha,M) := \min\left( N_C(b,\alpha), N_B(b,\alpha,M) \right),
\end{equation} 
$N_C$ is defined in \eqref{NCdef} and  $N_B$ is defined in \eqref{NB}.  Compute $\hmu_n$, the simple Monte Carlo estimator of $\mu$ based on $n$ samples, as in \eqref{simpleMCest}.  A probabilistic absolute error bound is given by
\[
\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n-\mu} \le \varepsilon \right] \geq 1-\alpha.
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} Note that \eqref{LP} implies that the third moment can be bounded in terms of the fourth moment, namely $M$ in Lemma \ref{BE} is no greater than $\kappa^{3/4}$. There are three primary random variables in this algorithm:  the estimated upper bound on the standard deviation, $\hsigma$, the sample size to estimate the mean, $n$, which is an explicit function of $\hsigma$, and the estimated mean, $\hmu_n$. By  \eqref{ChebErr} and \eqref{proberrcritsampleBE} it then follows that  $\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n-\mu} \le \varepsilon \right] \geq 1-\talpha$, provided that $\hsigma  \ge \sigma$. Thus, 
\begin{align*}
\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n-\mu} \le \varepsilon \right] &
= E_{\hsigma} \left\{\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_n-\mu} \le \varepsilon \ | \ \hsigma \right] \right\} \\
& \ge E_{\hsigma} \left\{(1-\talpha) 1_{[\sigma,\infty)}(\hsigma) \right\}\\
& \ge (1-\talpha) (1-\talpha) = 1-\alpha,
\end{align*}
since $\hsigma \ge \sigma$ with probability $1-\talpha$ by \eqref{kappamaxdef}.  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{remark} If one is willing to invest $n_\sigma$ samples to estimate $\sigma$, it makes practical sense to to choose the sample size for the sample mean at least that large, i.e, 
\[
n = \max(n_{\sigma},N_{CB}(\varepsilon/\hsigma,\talpha,\kappa_{\max}^{3/4})).
\]
By the error bound following from Chebyshev's inequality, \eqref{ChebErr}, this means that the probabilistic absolute error bound in Theorem \ref{mainadaptthm} also holds for integrands, $f$, lying in the ball $\cb_{\sigma_{\max}}$, defined in \eqref{ballintegdef}, where $\sigma_{\max} = \varepsilon \sqrt{\alpha n_{\sigma}}$.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Cost of the Algorithm}  The sample size of the adaptive algorithm defined in Theorem \ref{mainadaptthm} is a random variable, and so the cost of this algorithm might best be defined defined probabilistically.  Moreover, the cost depends strongly on $\sigma$ as well as the $\varepsilon$, and its definition should reflect this dependence. 

Let $A$ be any random algorithm defined for a set of integrands $\cf$ that takes as its input an error tolerance, $\varepsilon$, an uncertainty level, $\alpha$, and a  procedure for computing values of $f \in \cf$.  The algorithm then computes an approximation to the integral, $A(f,\varepsilon,\alpha)$.  This approximation is based solely on  $f(\vx_1), \ldots, f(\vx_n)$, where the choice of each $\vx_i$ may depend iteratively on $(\vx_1,f(\vx_1)), \ldots, (\vx_{i-1},f(\vx_{i-1}))$, and the decision to stop with $n$ data depends on all function data collected, up to and including the $n^{\text{th}}$.  The cost of this algorithm for this set of inputs is denoted $\cost(A,\varepsilon,\alpha,f)$, is the number of function values, $n$, which as noted is a random variable.  The probabilistic cost of the algorithm, with uncertainty $\beta$, for integrands of variance no greater than $\sigma^2_{\max}$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\cost(A,\varepsilon,\alpha,\beta,\cf,\sigma_{\max}) := \sup_{\substack{f \in \cf\\ \var(f)\le \sigma^2} } \min\left\{N : \Prob[\cost(A,\varepsilon,\alpha,f) \le N] \ge 1-\beta  \right \}.
\end{equation}

The cost of the particular adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm defined in Theorem \ref{mainadaptthm}, denoted $\aMC$, for the cone of integrands $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$ is
\begin{equation}
\cost(\aMC,\varepsilon,\alpha, \beta, \cc_{\kappa_{\max}}, \sigma_{\max}) := \sup_{\substack{f \in \cc_{\kappa_{\max}}\\ \var(f)\le \sigma^2_{\max}} } \min\left\{N : \Prob(n_{\sigma} + n \le N) \ge 1-\beta  \right \}.
\end{equation}
Since $n_{\sigma}$ is fixed, bounding this cost depends on bounding $n$, which depends on $\hsigma$ as given by Theorem \ref{mainadaptthm}.  Moreover, $\hsigma$ can be bounded above using \eqref{sampvarlo} in Lemma \ref{varbdlem}.  For $f \in \cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$, 
\begin{align*}
1-\beta & \le \Prob\left[\hv_{n_{\sigma}} < \sigma^2 \left\{1 + \sqrt{\left ( \kappa  - \frac{n_{\sigma}-3}{n_{\sigma}-1}\right)\left(\frac{1-\beta}{\beta n_{\sigma}}\right)}\right\} \right] \\
& \le \Prob\left[\hsigma^2 = \fudge^2 \hv_{n_{\sigma}} < \fudge^2\sigma^2 \left\{1 + \sqrt{\left ( \kappa_{\max}(n_{\sigma},\talpha,\fudge)  - \frac{n_{\sigma}-3}{n_{\sigma}-1}\right)\left(\frac{1-\beta}{\beta n_{\sigma}}\right)}\right\} \right] \\
%& = \Prob\left[\hsigma^2 < \fudge^2\sigma^2 \left\{1 + \sqrt{\left(\frac{ \talpha }{1-\talpha}\right) \left(\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{\fudge^2}\right)^2}\right\} \right] \\
& = \Prob\left[\hsigma^2 < \sigma^2 \gamma^2(\talpha,\beta,\fudge) \right],
\end{align*}
where
\[
\gamma^2(\talpha,\beta,\fudge) := \fudge^2 \left\{1 + \sqrt{\left(\frac{ \talpha }{1-\talpha}\right) \left(\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{\fudge^2}\right)^2}\right\} > 1.
\]
Noting that $N_{CB}(\cdot,\alpha,M)$ is a non-increasing function allows one to derive the following upper bound on the cost of the adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm.

\begin{theorem} \label{costtheorem} The adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm described in Theorem \ref{mainadaptthm}, denoted $\aMC$, has a probabilistic cost bounded above by 
\begin{equation*}
\cost(\aMC,\varepsilon,\alpha, \beta, \cc_{\kappa_{\max}}, \sigma_{\max})
\le n_{\sigma} + N_{CB}(\varepsilon/(\sigma_{\max}\gamma(\talpha,\beta,\fudge)),\talpha,\kappa_{\max}^{3/4}).
\end{equation*} 
\end{theorem}

The cost of the adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm $\aMC$ is roughly proportional to $\sigma^2_{\max}\varepsilon^{-2}$.  The set $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$ contains integrands with arbitrarily large variance, $\sigma^2=\var(f)$, and thus with potentially arbitrarily large algorithmic cost.  On the other hand, since the algorithm is adaptive, the cost may be small if $\sigma^2$ is small.  The upper bound in Theorem \ref{costtheorem} certainly scales with the $\sigma^2_{\max}$ as one might hope if $\sigma^2_{\max}$ were known.  The variable cost of the algorithm for integrands in $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$ is actually an advantage, rather than a drawback, of this analysis.  One need not make any a priori assumptions about the size of the integrand, $\sigma$, only about its kurtosis, $\kappa$, which is unchanged when the integrand is multiplied by an arbitrary nonzero constant.

\section{More Numerical Examples}

{\bf Lan will be adding to this section the multivariate examples.}

\section{A General Error Criterion} \label{relerrsec}

In many practical situations, one needs to approximate the integral with a certain relative accuracy.  For example, one wants an answer that is correct to three significant digits.  In this case, given a tolerance, $\varepsilon$, and a significance level $\alpha$, with $\varepsilon, \alpha \in (0, 1)$, one seeks a random $\tmu$ such that 
\begin{equation*} \label{relerrcrit}
\Prob\left[\abs{\frac{\tmu-\mu}{\mu}} \le \varepsilon \right] \geq 1-\alpha.
\end{equation*}
A more general form of this criterion would be
\begin{equation} \label{genrelerrcrit}
\Prob\left[\frac{\abs{\tmu-\mu}} {1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu}} \le \varepsilon \right] \geq 1-\alpha.
\end{equation}
for some fixed $\theta \in [0,1]$, where $\theta=0$ corresponds to absolute error, and $\theta = 1$ corresponds to relative error.  Clearly, one must have $(1-\theta) + \abs{\mu}\ne0$ for such a statement to be possible.  

If $\varepsilon_{A} \ge 0$ is an absolute error tolerance, and $\varepsilon_{R} \ge 0$ is a relative error tolerance, then letting 
\[
\varepsilon = \frac{\varepsilon_{A}\varepsilon_{R}}{\theta \varepsilon_{A} + (1-\theta) \varepsilon_{R}},
\]
it follows that for all $\theta \in [0,1]$,
\[
[1-\theta + \theta \abs{\mu}]\varepsilon = (1-\gamma)\varepsilon_{A} + \gamma \varepsilon_{R} \abs{\mu} \le \max(\varepsilon_{A},\varepsilon_{R} \abs{\mu}),
\]
where
\[
\gamma = \frac{\theta \varepsilon_{A}}{\theta \varepsilon_{A} + (1-\theta) \varepsilon_{R}} \in [0,1].
\]
Thus, error criterion  \eqref{genrelerrcrit} implies that one has satisfied either an absolute or a relative error criterion, 
\[
\Prob\left[\frac{\abs{\tmu-\mu}} {1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu}} \le \varepsilon \right] \geq 1-\alpha \implies \Prob\left[\abs{\tmu-\mu} \le \varepsilon_A \text{ or } \abs{\tmu-\mu} \le \abs{\mu}\varepsilon_R \right] \geq 1-\alpha.
\]
A value of $\gamma$ close to zero implies a preference to fulfill the absolute error criterion while a value of $\gamma$ close to one implies a preference to fulfill the relative error criterion.

Obtaining a confidence interval of the form \eqref{genrelerrcrit}, proceeds in three stages: i) obtaining an upper bound on $\sigma^2$, ii) obtaining a lower bound on $1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu}$, and iii) then using these to obtain \eqref{genrelerrcrit}.  What differs from the absolute error case is step ii).  For this step it is noted that
\begin{multline} \label{relerrcritd}
\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu-\mu} \le \hvareps \right] \ge 1-\alpha \implies \Prob[\max(\abs{\hmu}-\hvareps,0) \le \abs{\mu} \le \abs{\hmu}+\hvareps] \ge 1-\alpha \\
\implies \Prob[1-\theta + \theta\max(\abs{\hmu}-\hvareps,0) \le 1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu} \le 1-\theta + \theta(\abs{\hmu}+\hvareps)] \ge 1-\alpha.
\end{multline}
Although one might be happy the left side of this inequality being positive, if it is too much smaller than the right side, then one might be eventually expending too much extra work in step iii).  Thus, it makes sense to require 
\begin{gather*}
1-\theta + \theta\max(\abs{\hmu}-\hvareps,0) \ge \hdelta [1-\theta + \theta(\abs{\hmu}+\hvareps)] \\
\iff \hvareps = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle \frac{(1-\hdelta)(1-\theta)}{\hdelta \theta} -\abs{\hmu}, & 
\displaystyle 0 \le \abs{\hmu}  < \frac{(1-\hdelta)(1-\theta)}{2 \hdelta \theta},
 \\[2ex]
\displaystyle \frac{1-\hdelta}{1+\hdelta} \left[\frac{1-\theta}{\theta} +\abs{\hmu}\right], & 
\displaystyle \frac{(1-\hdelta)(1-\theta)}{2 \hdelta \theta} \le \abs{\hmu}  < \infty.
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}
This is done iteratively in the algorithm described in Theorem \ref{relerradaptthm} below.  One needs to prevent $\hvareps$ from becoming too small.  This means that $\hdelta$ should kept away from $1$, which means that the lower bound on $1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu}$ is allowed to be somewhat smaller than the upper bound.  Preventing $\hvareps$ from becoming too small also means that $1-\theta + \abs{\hmu}$ cannot be too small. This may be unavoidable if one is interested in relative error $\theta=1$, and the true answer, $\mu$, is small.

Some notation is needed for this theorem.  For any fixed $\alpha \in (0,1)$, and $M>0$, define the inverse of the functions $N_C(\cdot,\alpha)$, $N_B(\cdot,\alpha,M)$, and $N_{CB}(\cdot,\alpha,M)$,
%\begin{subequations} \label{probadapterrcritBE}
\begin{gather*}\label{NCinv}
N_C^{-1}(n,\alpha) := \frac{1}{\sqrt{n \alpha}}, \\
\label{NBinv*}
N_B^{-1}(n,\alpha,M) := \min \left \{ b>0 : \Phi\left(-b \sqrt{n}  \right)+\frac{0.56M}{\sqrt{n}\left(1+ b\sqrt{n} \right)^{3}}
\le \frac{\alpha}{2} \right \}, \\
\label{NCBinv*}
N_{CB}^{-1}(n,\alpha,M) := \min(N_C^{-1}(n,\alpha),N_B^{-1}(n,\alpha,M)).
\end{gather*}
It then follows then by Chebyshev's inequality and the Berry-Esseen Inequality (see \eqref{BEresult}) that 
\begin{equation*}
\Prob[\abs{\hmu_n -\mu}<\hvareps] \geq 1-\alpha, \quad \text{provided } \ f \in \cc_{\kappa_{\max}}, \text{ where }\hvareps=\sigma(f) N_{CB}^{-1}(n,\alpha,\kappa_{\max}^{3/4}), 
\end{equation*} 
%\end{subequations}
and $\sigma(f)=\sqrt{\var(f)}$ is the standard deviation of the integrand.  Given a significance level, $\alpha \in (0,1)$, let $\alpha_{\sigma}, \alpha_{\mu}, \alpha_1,  \alpha_2, \ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive numbers all less than one, such that 
\begin{equation} \label{alphaseq}
(1-\alpha_{\sigma})(1-\alpha_{\mu})(1-\alpha_1)(1-\alpha_2) \cdots = 1-\alpha.
\end{equation}
For example, one might choose $\alpha_{\sigma},\alpha_{\mu},$ and $\halpha$ such that $(1-\alpha_{\sigma})(1-\alpha_{\mu})(1-\halpha)=1-\alpha$, and then 
\begin{equation} \label{alphaseqex}
\alpha_{i} = 1-(1-\halpha)^{(a-1)a^{-i}}, \ i\in \naturals, \quad \text{where} \  a \in (1,\infty).
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem} \label{relerradaptthm} Specify the following parameters defining the algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item sample size for variance estimation, $n_{\sigma} \in \naturals$,
\item initial sample size for mean estimation, $n_1 \in \naturals$,
\item variance inflation factor for variance estimation, $\fudge \in (1,\infty)$, 
\item factors for Step 2, $\hdelta, \delta, \tdelta \in (0,1)$, with $\delta < \tdelta$.
\item uncertainty tolerance, $\alpha\in (0,1)$, and a sequence $\alpha_{\sigma}, \alpha_{\mu}, \alpha_1,  \alpha_2, \ldots$ satisfying \eqref{alphaseq}, 
\item the parameter $\theta \in [0,1]$, used to define the general error criterion \eqref{genrelerrcrit}, and
\item the error tolerance, $\varepsilon >0$. 
\end{itemize} 
Let $\kappa_{\max}=\kappa_{\max}(n_{\sigma},\alpha_{\sigma},\fudge)$ as defined in \eqref{kappamaxdef}.  For any $f$ lying in the cone of functions with bounded kurtosis, $\cc_{\kappa_{\max}}$, do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
%\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi})}
\item {\bf Bounding the variance of the integrand from above.} Compute the sample variance, $\hv_{n_{\sigma}}$ using a simple random sample of size $n_{\sigma}$. Use this to approximate the variance of $f$ by $\hsigma^2 = \fudge^2 \hv_{n_{\sigma}}$, as in \eqref{samplevar}. Compute the width of initial the confidence interval for the mean, $\hvareps_1=\hsigma N_{CB}^{-1}(n_1,\alpha_1,\kappa_{\max}^{3/4})$.

\item \label{boundcstep} {\bf Bounding the denominator in the error criterion  from below.} For $i=1, 2, \ldots$, do the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Compute the sample average $\hmu_{n_i}$ using a simple random sample that is independent of those used to compute $\hv_{n_{\sigma}}$ and $\hmu_{n_1}, \ldots, \hmu_{n_{i-1}}$.

\item Compute $\fc=1-\theta + \theta\max(\abs{\hmu_{n_i}}-\hvareps_{i},0)$, a confident lower bound on $1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu}$, according to \eqref{relerrcritd}.  If $\fc \ge \delta [1 - \theta + \theta(\abs{\hmu_{n_i}} + \hvareps)]$, then $\fc$ is large enough.  Set $\tau=i$ and go to Step \ref{hmufinalstep}.

\item \label{newhvarepsstep} Else, compute the next tolerance for the sample mean
\begin{gather*}
\hvareps_{0} = \begin{cases}
\displaystyle \frac{(1-\hdelta)(1-\theta)}{\hdelta \theta} -\abs{\hmu_{n_i}}, & 
\displaystyle 0 \le \abs{\hmu_{n_i}}  < \frac{(1-\hdelta)(1-\theta)}{2 \hdelta \theta},
 \\[2ex]
\displaystyle \frac{1-\hdelta}{1+\hdelta} \left[\frac{1-\theta}{\theta} +\abs{\hmu_{n_i}}\right], & 
\displaystyle \frac{(1-\hdelta)(1-\theta)}{2 \hdelta \theta} \le \abs{\hmu_{n_i}}  < \infty,
\end{cases}\\
\hvareps_{i+1} = \max(\min(\hvareps_0, \tdelta \hvareps_i), \delta \hvareps_i).
\end{gather*}


\item Define the next sample size, $n_{i+1} = N_{CB}(\hvareps_{i+1}/\hsigma,\alpha_{i+1},\kappa_{\max}^{3/4})$,
increase $i$ by one, and go to step a). 

\end{enumerate}

\item \label{hmufinalstep} {\bf Computing the sample mean to sufficient accuracy.} Compute the sample size  $n = N_{CB}(\fc \varepsilon/\hsigma,\alpha_\mu,\kappa_{\max}^{3/4})$. Compute $\tmu=\hmu_{n}$ using a simple random sample that is independent of those used to compute $\hv_{n_{\sigma}}$ and $\hmu_{n_1}, \ldots, \hmu_{n_{\tau}}$. Terminate the algorithm.

\end{enumerate}
If this algorithm terminates, then the general error criterion, \eqref{genrelerrcrit}, is satisfied.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} In this algorithm there are a number of important random variables:  the estimated upper bound on the standard deviation, $\hsigma$, the sample sizes $n_1, \ldots, n_\tau, n$, the number of iterations, $\tau$, required to get a good  lower bound $\fc$, and the final estimate of the mean $\tmu=\hmu_n$. These sample means are conditionally independent given the sequence of sample sizes.  The probability that the final confidence interval is correct, is then no less than the probability that all of the confidence intervals are correct, conditioned on the sample sizes.  Specifically,
\begin{align*}
\Prob\left[\frac{\abs{\tmu-\mu}} {1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu}} \le \varepsilon \right] & 
\ge \Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_{n}-\mu} \le \fc \varepsilon \ \& \ \fc\le 1-\theta + \theta\abs{\mu} \right] \\
& = E \left\{\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_{n}-\mu} \le \fc \varepsilon \ \& \ \abs{\hmu_{n_{\tau}}-\mu} \le \hvareps_\tau \ | \ \hsigma, \tau, n_1, \ldots, n_{\tau},n \right] \right\} \\
& \ge E \left\{\Prob\left[\abs{\hmu_{n}-\mu} \le \fc \varepsilon \ \& \ \abs{\hmu_{n_{i}}-\mu} \le \hvareps_i \ \forall i \ | \ \hsigma, \tau, n_1, \ldots, n_{\tau} \right] \right\} \\
& \ge E_{\hsigma} \left\{[(1-\alpha_\mu)(1-\alpha_1) )(1-\alpha_2) \cdots ] 1_{[\sigma,\infty)}(\hsigma) \right\}\\
& \ge (1-\alpha_{\sigma}) (1-\alpha_\mu) (1-\alpha_1)(1-\alpha_2) \cdots = 1-\alpha. \qquad \qed
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark} Step \ref{boundcstep} in this algorithm is not needed for the case of pure absolute error $\theta=0$, because $\fc=1$ automatically, which is large enough.  As suggested earlier, a difficulty may arise if $\mu \approx 0$ and $\theta \approx 1$, in which the algorithm may fail to converge in a reasonable number of steps and overall sample size.  Step \ref{newhvarepsstep} has safeguards against making $\hvareps_{i+1}$ too small compared to $\hvareps_{i}$, but this may also increase the number of iterations, $\tau$, necessary for completion of Step \ref{boundcstep}.  Because it is difficult to knowing how large $\tau$ is for a given integrand, there is no rigorous bound on the cost of this algorithm yet.
\end{remark}
